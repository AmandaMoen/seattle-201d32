## Notes on 301

301 is very different overall, and is structured to give you more of a feel of doing code in a professional environment. How? A big adjustment will be afternoon lectures (2:00-5:00pm) and morning labs (9:00am-1:00pm):

* The first two weeks we will be working in starter code every day, fulfilling assigned tasks that extend the existing codebase. The reality of working as a dev is that you rarely (if ever) get to work on a project from scratch. Code-reading, collaboration, and the capacity to speak about it are emphasized.
* Pair-programming with a different partner every day in the first two weeks. Just like work, you do not get to choose who you work with from day to day.
* Labs are not published until 9:00 in the mornings. Think of it like showing up for work in the morning and getting to work without being allowed to work from home. If you choose to do some reading in the evenings to prepare that's fine, but you don't get access to the codebase until you get to work.

In Week 3 we'll be working on a new stand-alone app that we DO build totally from scratch, and you'll work with the same partner for that whole week. Week 4 is project week as you've just experienced.

Let's go get a photo!

One last random cool thing: Code Fellows is now starting to make some short videos of some 401 grads featuring their stories. [Check them out! And feel free to share them.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgUnlWmteg8oR4Gej4SEVAZeG-a7dS6XJ)

And... we're done! Get some rest before 301!
