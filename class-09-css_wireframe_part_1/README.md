#### Announcements!

- ***DEEP BREATH***....... This kind of is a catch-up day for us, and also the day we leave the most wide-open and with the least amount of new content involved. Why?
    - Adult learning cycle: we need time to reflect and refine our thoughts.
    - The labs on each of the next two days are of much lower intensity than the others this week, and easier to work at on your own, leaving you room to get caught up on the Mon-Wed labs.
    - We can now focusing more on refactoring working code, and also improving UI/UX.

- Today's one-on-one meetings:
 
  - 2:00: Panos
  - 2:15: Daniel
  - 2:30: Yannick
  - 2:45: Sarah
  - 3:00: Collin
  - 3:45: Amanda

- We know it's been a hard few days, but the class is doing very well. The TAs and Sam are extremely pleased with how you all help one another.
- It's not to soon to start thinking about final projects. Let's have a brief conversation about that today, because a week from tomorrow you're going to be divided up into teams, and  a week from tomorrow starting planning on your projects.
- Tomorrow we'll look at some projects from prior classes and talk a bit about what to expect from Project Week.
