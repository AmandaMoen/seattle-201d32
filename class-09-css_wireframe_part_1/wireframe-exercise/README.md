# HTML/CSS Wireframe Exercise

We'll start this in class together.

Create a new repo titled 'wirefame-exercise' and add `index.html`, `style.css`, and `reset.css` files.

The specifications for the wireframe are in the adjacent image documents in this directory. One of the images (**wireframe-comp**) shows what the finished product should look like, and the other (**wireframe-annotated**) shows specifications and dimensions.

Follow along with the class lecture that will be done in CodePen, entering your code in the files.

We will only complete part of this wireframe in class today; you will need to do the rest on your own.
